# Cauliflower Rice California Rolls

**TIME:** 30 minutes
**SERVINGS:** 4-6

## Ingredients

* 1 bag of Trader Joe's cauliflower rice
* 6 seaweed sheets
* 2 tbsp avocado or olive oil
* 1 tbsp of Tahini
* 6 oz of cooked shrimp, smoked salmon, or crab
* 2 avocados, sliced
* 1 cup of shredded carrots
* 1 shredded cucumber
* 1 cup of spinach (optional)


Saute cauliflower rice in pan with oil for 4-6 minutes. Remove from heat and mix in Tahini.

Put enough avocado, carrots, shrimp/salmon/crab, cucumber, carrots, and spinach to cover 1/3 of a seaweed wrap (position slightly off-center). Be careful to not overstuff or it will be difficult to wrap. Wet the edge of the seaweed and roll tightly with a sushi roller.

Repeat until all six rolls are made.
